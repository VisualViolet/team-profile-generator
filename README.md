## Description

This Team Profile Generator is a Node.js command-line application that takes user input using the Inquirer package to generate a team profile HTML page. I built this application to reinforce ideas learned this week in the UW Coding Bootcamp, which included OOP concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Variables, methods, and classes were used to add functionality without compromising code comprehension. The page this app creates can be very useful for any collaborative team as it allows a user to see at a glance team composition and relevant contact information all in one place! Building this project helped me to learn the importance of object-oriented programming and provided a great segue into back-end development.

## Installation

No installation is necessary! Since this is a command-line application, a deployed link will not be available. Please see the above and below demonstrations to view functionality.

## Usage

The main purpose of this application is to take user input and generate a team dashboard for reference - useful for any project of any size! To start this application, we open up integrated terminal and run the command "node index.js". Inquirer will prompt you with a series of questions for you to answer by typing in the console and pressing "Enter". When you've added all of your team members, simply pick the "I'm done building my team" option and the HTML file will be generated for you! I viewed the final page using Live Server. Students and new developers may find it helpful to view the code files to see how this application was built and how all of the different classes/methods work together. Code has been commented tp describe functionality.
